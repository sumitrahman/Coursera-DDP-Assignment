# Coursera-DDP-Assignment
The files for the main assignment in the Coursera Developing Data Products course

These files are used for creating my first Shiny app (interactive Cleveland dotplots for staff survey results) as well as a presentation using the R Presentation format in R Studio.

The dataset is aggregated and anonymised because the app is publicly available on RPubs and the data and code are here in Git Hub.

I took the Coursera Developing Data Products course starting in December 2015.
